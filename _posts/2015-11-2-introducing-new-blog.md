<p class="message">organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations -- M. Conway</p>

This is known as [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law).
In light of it, it seems fair to say that the design and content of this blog
is a reflection of the communication structures that the system of myself
makes use of.

I find that I have at the moment forgotten what the purpose of this blog was
supposed to be. Perhaps I should work on my self-awareness. I guess this is
sort of a journal. I wanted to make a blog was for greater self-awareness: to
try to get a better hold on my self, if only by being slightly more effusive.

In fact, I'd like to refine that. I find that I am effusive already. I have
plenty to say, I just say most of it to myself. So, there again is a better
idea of why I am writing... I really want to start doing this whole
communication thing more properly. I find I am doing it. So, I'd like to
let the purpose inherent in what I am doing flow more freely, and be more true.

I'd like to communicate information to people who don't already have it.
That sounds so fresh. I wonder as I write whether I have anything to say that
isn't largely known. Anyway, I am content with this as a first piece.
It was good.
