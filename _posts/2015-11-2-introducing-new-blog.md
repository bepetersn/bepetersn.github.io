<p class="message">organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations -- M. Conway</p>

This is known as [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law).
In light of it, it seems fair to say that the design and content of this blog
is a reflection of the communication structures that the system of myself
makes use of.

I find that I have at the moment forgotten what the purpose of this blog was
supposed to be. Perhaps I should work on my self-awareness.

I guess this is sort of a journal. I wanted to make a blog to try to get a
better hold on my self, if only by being slightly more effusive. In fact, I
find that I am effusive already. I have plenty to say, I just say most of it
to myself. So... I really want to start doing this whole communication thing
more properly. I find I am doing it. Now, I'd like to let the purpose inherent
in what I am doing flow more freely, and be more true.

I'd like to communicate information to people who don't already have it.
That sounds so *fresh*. I think this is at the heart of using words and
communicating in the first place. I wonder as I write what I have to say that
isn't already known. Anyway, I am content with this as a first piece. It was
good.
